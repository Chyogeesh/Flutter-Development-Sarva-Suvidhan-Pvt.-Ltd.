It is an internship assignment
To complete the Implement Biometric Login Inside the App assignment, I'll provide a solution that integrates biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition) into a mobile application, focusing on enhancing security and user experience. Given the context of the previous React Native assignment and the mention of apps like CRED, I'll implement this for a React Native mobile app using the react-native-biometrics library, which supports fingerprint and face recognition on iOS (Touch ID/Face ID) and Android (fingerprint/biometrics). The solution will build on the previous React Native Login Screen UI, adding biometric login functionality, and include a JSON configuration for backend integration. I'll also address the research component by explaining biometric authentication concepts and implementation steps.

Part 1: Research & Understanding
Biometric Authentication Overview:

Definition: Biometric authentication verifies a user’s identity using unique physical characteristics like fingerprints or facial features, offering a secure and convenient alternative to passwords.
Benefits:
Security: Biometrics are harder to replicate than passwords, reducing unauthorized access risks.
User Experience: Quick login with a touch or glance, eliminating password fatigue.
Adoption: Widely used in apps like CRED for secure transactions and seamless access. 86% of surveyed users prefer biometrics for ease, though only 46% consider it more secure than passwords.
Technologies:
Mobile Platforms: iOS uses Touch ID/Face ID; Android uses fingerprint or face recognition via BiometricPrompt.
WebAuthn: For web apps, the Web Authentication API enables biometric authentication via device authenticators.
Security Considerations:
Biometric data is stored locally on the device (e.g., iOS Secure Enclave, Android Keystore), not sent to servers, ensuring privacy.
Encryption is critical to protect sensitive data, like tokens, behind biometric prompts.
Risks include bypassing biometrics via memory manipulation, mitigated by code hardening (e.g., DexGuard).
Use Case (CRED): CRED uses biometric login for secure access to financial services, combining fingerprint/face recognition with backend token validation to ensure trust and speed.
Implementation Approach:

Use react-native-biometrics to integrate biometric authentication into the React Native Login Screen.
Store a login token securely using react-native-keychain after successful username/password login.
Enable biometric login to retrieve the token, mimicking CRED’s seamless experience.
Include input validation and a backend JSON configuration for authentication.
Implementation Steps:
Setup Project:
Create a new Expo project: expo init BiometricLoginApp.
Install dependencies: npm install react-native-keychain && expo install expo-local-authentication.
Replace App.js and add biometricService.js, utils.js, and backendConfig.json.
Code Explanation:
App.js: Extends the previous Login Screen with biometric login. Checks biometric availability on mount and attempts login if supported. Stores credentials in Keychain after manual login and prompts for biometric enrollment.
biometricService.js: Handles biometric checks and authentication using expo-local-authentication, supporting both iOS and Android.
utils.js: Reuses email validation from the previous assignment.
backendConfig.json: Updated to include a biometricToken field for server-side validation of biometric login.
Security:
Biometric data stays on-device (iOS Secure Enclave, Android Keystore).
Credentials are encrypted in Keychain, ensuring secure storage.
User Experience:
Seamless biometric login on app start, similar to CRED’s quick access.
Fallback to password login if biometrics fail or are unavailable.
Backend Integration:
The JSON configuration allows sending a biometric token to the server, which can verify the user’s identity using public/private key pairs or tokens.
Deliverables:
Source Code: Provided above in App.js, biometricService.js, utils.js, and backendConfig.json.
Screenshot/Video: Run the app on a physical device with biometric support (e.g., iPhone with Face ID or Android with fingerprint). Record a 2–5 minute video showing:
Manual login with email/password.
Enabling biometric login via prompt.
Successful biometric login on app restart.
Explain the code structure, security measures, and UX benefits.
Upload the video to Google Drive and share the link.
README.md: Included above, detailing setup and functionality.
Submission: Email the GitHub repository link (or code files), video link, and page URL (if hosted) to jobs@unusualdigital.com with subject: "[Your Name] - WordPress Developer Internship Assignment Submission."
Notes:
Test on a physical device with biometric hardware for full functionality (emulators may not support biometrics).
The code is responsive, reusing the previous assignment’s styles for consistency.
For web apps, WebAuthn could be used (e.g., via SimpleWebAuthn), but this solution focuses on mobile due to CRED’s context and React Native’s mobile-first nature.
Ensure the device has biometrics enabled (Settings > Touch ID/Face ID on iOS, or Security > Biometrics on Android).
